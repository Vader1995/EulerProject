    <string name="sum_square_difference_description">
        The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,
        1^2 + 2^2 + … + 10^2 = 385
        \nThe square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,
        (1 + 2 + … + 10)^2 = 55^2 = 3025
        \nHence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and
        the square of the sum is 3025 − 385 = 2640.
        \n\nEnter in a list of numbers separated by spaces.
